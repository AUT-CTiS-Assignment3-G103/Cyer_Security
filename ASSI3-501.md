Nowadays, modern science and technology have deeply influenced every aspect of society and produced a very important impact. The development of society also with the progress of science and technology, promote the  economic development of the society, so that human living standards  continue to improve. Science and technology also enrich people's  experience and life. For example, TV, video and so on have reformed  people's thoughts and opinions to varying degrees. However, due to  people's dependence on science and technology, the development of society has produced some negative effects, which has caused a certain  degree of damage to human's life and living environment. Therefore, there is a study on laptop computers, which specifically discusses the different influences of laptop computers on students' learning in terms of opportunity, Risk, Choice and other aspects.

### Technology/Topic: 

For many years, writing and listening have always been essential in education. Education has always been an important topic in the world. "The students can obtain high-quality information, they can develop their autonomy, they  will have greater attentiveness, they will get individualized differentiated learning"(Soffar, 2015). Nowadays, laptop computers have become very popular in the society. As the cost of laptops has fallen, the popularity of the Internet and the increasing practical demand of college students has caused the proportion of college students who own laptop computers to reach the point that almost every one of them owns one. Unlike desktop computers, the biggest advantage of laptops is that they are easy to carry. This means that as long as the Internet is available, students can start dealing with learning problems at any time. Also different from mobile phones, laptops are more powerful and have many functions that mobile phones can't do. Such as programming, drawing software, powerful video clip function and so on. Therefore, that is the reason we chose this technology as a topic to do a research. 



### Opportunities: 

Students who use laptops in class have several advantages, such as more efficient and detailed notes, faster editing, and easy group work and study.

###### Accessibility and connectivity

One of the advantages of laptops is that students can get information anywhere they have access to the Internet. With more and more places offering free Wi-Fi, it's easier than ever to connect to the Internet. This ease of use allows students to learn at any time -- no matter where they are. Increased use of educational tools, such as educational programs and websites, can improve students' performance in class.

###### Efficiency

Laptops can improve the efficiency and quality of doing works. Which means through the internet, student can search more information and resources to support their assignment or research instead of renting many books to find references. "Students received more feedback on their writing, edited and revised their papers more often, drew on a wider range of resources to write, and published or shared their work with others more often"(Estreet, 2017). This can saving time, and informatization can also enrich students' viewpoints.

Laptops will speed up group works as well. Group cooperation is essential at every stage, and students completing an assignment by cooperating with others is quite different from individual learning. Due to the randomness of group members and the difference in leisure time of each person, it is difficult for everyone to often make an appointment to discuss the process together. But laptops make it easier to work in groups, and students can respond to messages and communicate ideas anytime and anywhere. Creating online editing documents and transferring them to each other at the same time gives them easy access to the required materials and keeps track of others' progress. 

"Teachers may edit student papers and return them digitally to offer more detailed feedback"(Estreet, 2017b). Which means  teacher can write comments more detailed and not just mark it. Students can know their shortcomings and how to correct them so that they can get the correct answer, instead of each student going to the teacher to answer the question separately. In this way, paper can always be saved on the computer or website instead of the paper-based assignment which is easy to lose.

###### Entertainment

In addition to busy study, students also need some relaxation and recreation. And the laptop supports a lot of entertainment, such as watching movies, playing video games, e-books and so on. Students can choose according to their own hobbies, instead of having to go to the cinema or the library.

##### Function:

On the other hand, the basic functions of laptop computers will improve students' personal learning ability.

1. ###### Notes

This website is about the impact of laptop computers on society. More specifically, is the impact of laptops on students. Students need to master all the key points in every lecture or lab. Meanwhile, students have few physics textbooks except for the slides in class. Therefore, correct, complete and relaxed reading is an important link for students to check. Instead of writing on notebook, tapping notes on laptops are more convenience and environmental. 

1. ###### Communication

Email is another basic function, which provides a convenient communication bridge between the students and the school. Without laptops, if students find problems in their free time or holidays, they can't get quick answers from the person in charge. But now, students can use an email application or a web page to get access to it and then send and receive emails everywhere and every time. Professors often post assignments and added learning materials on the school's website. There are some online reading materials that give students the opportunity to study extra and improve their grades, such as doing multiple exercises. More and more schools are offering free licenses, like Microsoft. Students can enjoy a safe, professional and uninterrupted online environment through their school account.

### Ethical issue and Reflective report--Individual--Ziyuan Lyu(18027144)

Ethical issue: 

"Ethics  refers  to  a  set  of  rules  that  define  right  and  wrong  behavior,  used  for  moral decision-making" (Hussein & Mohamed, 2010). In this topic, students should regulate the use of computers to study and see basic computer ethics. Such as reasonable use of software and websites for data collection and not cheating. When using computer software or data, student needs to respect the copyright and author, mark references when citing it. Also, students should not use other people's computer resources without permission, steal other's work, interfere with other people's computer work, or send malicious virus files.

###### Reflection and recommendation:

Although laptops can bring many benefits to study, but student still needs to improve their self-control to prevent games and video websites from taking up most of their energy. Students should arrange their work and rest reasonably and increase outdoor activities instead of spending too much time on the computer each day. 

More over, cyber security is also crucial. Information in the process of network flow may be intercepted, interrupted, modified and other security attacks. Students may encounter a hacker attack, or the computer may suddenly go down and the software may crash. Therefore, it is particularly important to back up and master basic network security knowledge at any time. Schools should open and popularize lectures on how to do a good job in the basic protection of network security for students of all majors, to better cope with the problems.
