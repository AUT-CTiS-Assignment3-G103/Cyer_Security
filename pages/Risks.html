                        With the development of network technology, the Internet onto the desk, into thousands of
                        households, online learning, online office, online payment, online trading, online entertainment
                        gradually become a reality. However, while people enjoy the great benefits brought by the
                        network, they also unknowingly bear the accompanying security risks. Virus invasion, Trojan
                        attack, malicious port scanning, strong password cracking, light will cause computer breakdown,
                        heavy will cause data leakage and loss, causing irreparable losses or disastrous consequences.
                        However, these security risks have not been taken seriously, especially in laptops.

                    <h2 id="t1">Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the development of the Internet, computer viruses have seriously affected people's
                        information security, property security and so on. At the present stage, the society is widely
                        concerned about the laptop security and computer virus pre©vention work and increase the
                        research efforts to prevent computer virus technology, in order to reduce the probability of
                        virus invasion, improve the security and reliability of computer operation.“Security is the
                        attribute of a computer system that ensures that it can continue to function properly after an
                        attack”（Baecker, 2019）.

                    <h2 id="t2">Major threats to laptop security：</h2>
                    <h3 id="t2.1">There is a bug in the operating system</h3>
                    <p>
                        Even if the operating system is more advanced, more perfect, design defects are inevitable, and
                        the existence of system design defects can lead to the laptop in danger
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="t2.2">Virus regeneration</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the present stage, the known types of computer viruses reach more than one million, and each
                        virus has varieties, at least tens of thousands, many hundreds of thousands of kinds, even if
                        the timely download, install security patches, the normal use of anti-virus software, virus
                        mutation, still may attack the laptop.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, it is necessary to install anti-virus software, anti-virus software should choose the
                        genuine version, and in the system prompt update, upgrade, update in time, in order to give full
                        play to the role of anti-virus software. In addition to technical preventive measures, users in
                        the process of using a laptop, but also should form a good habit of using a laptop, as we all
                        know, the network facilitates people's life and work, promote social progress, but with the
                        development of the network, the emergence of viruses, a serious threat to people's computer
                        security, One of the main reasons for the virus to invade is that people's computer use habits
                        are not good, the lack of sufficient awareness of prevention, therefore, to promote people's
                        awareness of protecting computer security.

                    <h2 id="t3">Safety</h2>
                    <p>
                        What is the difference between Security and Safety in laptop? “Here's the biggest difference
                        between safety and security. Safety means no harm is caused, deliberately or not. Security means
                        that no deliberate harm is caused” (Foster, 2020). With the development of society, we rely more
                        and more on software to serve us. All kinds of safety problems due to imperfect software will
                        gradually appear. The program dominated by software may cause serious harm to human beings or
                        even threaten life due to design defects. For example, the mobile laptop of the space shuttle
                        may make mistakes and lead to misjudgment, thus leading to the accident of the plane. Digital
                        technology has both improved and often endangered our lives,
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="t4">Privacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the frequent occurrence of personal privacy leakage events at home and abroad and the
                        importance of personal privacy protection, people are paying more and more attention to the
                        personal privacy problems brought by computer software, mobile terminals and high technology in
                        daily work and life. Unlike desktop computers, which are used in fixed occasions, laptops often
                        need to accompany us in and out of various indoor and outdoor occasions, so they will face
                        severe privacy security challenges. “Most laptops (and tablets) today come with built-in,
                        front-facing cameras for video chat. What some users might not realize is that the cameras can
                        be used against them for spying” (Martin, 2016). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering the necessity of users' actual
                        scene operation requirements, the screen port of laptop products in the market will be equipped
                        with cameras. The camera is usually used while the user is making a video call, but is often
                        idle the rest of the time, which raises the question of how does the user know if the camera is
                        working? The computer background is generally multitasking synchronous operation, most users do
                        not know the actual performance of each running task as professional programmers. So, if in the
                        process of the use of the product, by malicious trojans, viruses, the camera will become outlaws
                        peep at the first window user privacy, and the consequences of its harm is immeasurable, most
                        brands did not realize at the time of meet the demand of the application scenario, behind
                        privacy problems of how to solve.
