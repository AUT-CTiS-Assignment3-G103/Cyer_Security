                        Students who use laptops in class have several advantages, such as more efficient and detailed
                        notes,
                        faster editing, and easy group work and study.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="t1">Accessibility and connectivity</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the advantages of laptops is that students can get information anywhere they have access
                        to
                        the Internet. With more and more places offering free Wi-Fi, it's easier than ever to connect to
                        the
                        Internet. This ease of use allows students to learn at any time -- no matter where they are.
                        Increased use of educational tools, such as educational programs and websites, can improve
                        students'
                        performance in class.

                    <h2 id="t2">Efficiency</h2>
                    <p>
                        Laptops can improve the efficiency and quality of doing works. Which means through the internet,
                        student can search more information and resources to support their assignment or research
                        instead of
                        renting many books to find references. "Students received more feedback on their writing, edited
                        and
                        revised their papers more often, drew on a wider range of resources to write, and published or
                        shared their work with others more often"(Estreet, 2017). This can saving time, and
                        informatization
                        can also enrich students' viewpoints.

                        Laptops will speed up group works as well. Group cooperation is essential at every stage, and
                        students completing an assignment by cooperating with others is quite different from individual
                        learning. Due to the randomness of group members and the difference in leisure time of each
                        person,
                        it is difficult for everyone to often make an appointment to discuss the process together. But
                        laptops make it easier to work in groups, and students can respond to messages and communicate
                        ideas
                        anytime and anywhere. Creating online editing documents and transferring them to each other at
                        the
                        same time gives them easy access to the required materials and keeps track of others' progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Teachers may edit student papers and return them digitally to offer more detailed
                        feedback"(Estreet, 2017b). Which means teacher can write comments more detailed and not just
                        mark
                        it. Students can know their shortcomings and how to correct them so that they can get the
                        correct
                        answer, instead of each student going to the teacher to answer the question separately. In this
                        way,
                        paper can always be saved on the computer or website instead of the paper-based assignment which
                        is
                        easy to lose.

                    <h2 id="t3">Entertainment</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to busy study, students also need some relaxation and recreation. And the laptop
                        supports a lot of entertainment, such as watching movies, playing video games, e-books and so
                        on. Students can choose according to their own hobbies, instead of having to go to the cinema or
                        the library.

                        On the other hand, the basic functions of laptop computers will improve students' personal
                        learning ability.

                        Notes
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This website is about the impact of laptop computers on society. More specifically, is the
                        impact of laptops on students. Students need to master all the key points in every lecture or
                        lab. Meanwhile, students have few physics textbooks except for the slides in class. Therefore,
                        correct, complete and relaxed reading is an important link for students to check. Instead of
                        writing on notebook, tapping notes on laptops are more convenience and environmental.

                    </p>
                    <h3 id="4.2">Communication</h3>
                    <p>Email is another basic function, which provides a convenient communication bridge between the
                        students and the school. Without laptops, if students find problems in their free time or
                        holidays, they can't get quick answers from the person in charge. But now, students can use an
                        email application or a web page to get access to it and then send and receive emails everywhere
                        and every time. Professors often post assignments and added learning materials on the school's
                        website. There are some online reading materials that give students the opportunity to study
                        extra and improve their grades, such as doing multiple exercises. More and more schools are
                        offering free licenses, like Microsoft. Students can enjoy a safe, professional and
                        uninterrupted online environment through their school account.
